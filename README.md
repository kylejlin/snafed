# Snatcit

Snatcit is a web app that lets you mark times in an audio file, and then export those times as a JSON file.

This can be useful for creating `oto.ini` files.

## Pronunciation of "snatcit"

Officially, the name is pronounced [Lojbanically](https://lojban.github.io/cll/3/2/).
In practice, "snatch it" is close enough.

## Why not use SetParam?

You _should_ use SetParam, if you can.

However, at the time of writing, I cannot get SetParam working on my computer (maybe because I have an M1 Mac), so I built this web app to use instead.

## Usage

Please read the [user guide](./docs/user_guide.md).

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome.

However, at this time, I do not plan on contributing much more code to this project myself. So, if you submit a feature request, you'll need to implement the feature yourself (unless someone else wants to implement it for you), and open a PR.
